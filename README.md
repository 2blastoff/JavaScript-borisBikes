Boris bikes is a system used in London for hiring a bike. Bikes can be picked up in one location from a docking station and then dropped off at a different location, a new docking station.

This program allows a bike to be picked up from a docking station and returned to another docking station. If the bike is broken it can be returned and a van will pick up the broken bike and take it to a garage to be fixed. When the bike is fixed the van will pick up the bike from the garage and return it to the docking station.
